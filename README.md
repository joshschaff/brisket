# Backcast Reconstruction of Inferred SCED and ERCOT Topology

The goal of this project is to simulate historical price formation in the ERCOT RT market using only publicly available datasets. This will consist of
 - Estimating shift factors from historical prices
 - Reconstructing a simplified model of the ERCOT topology from publically available datasets
 - Parsing offers and available units from 60 day SCED disclosures
 - Formulating and optimizing a modified economic dispatch model to get simulated prices
